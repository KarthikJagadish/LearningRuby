# LearningRuby
Notes on learning Ruby language - learning from CodeAcademy, GeeksForGeeks and other sources

Ruby - Powerful, flexible programming language - can be used for web development, to process text, to create games, and as part of the popular Ruby on Rails framework.

- High-level: Reading and writing Ruby is very easy - looks a lot like regular English
- Interpreted: A compiler is not needed to write and run Ruby as opposed to compiled language
- Object-oriented: Allows users to manipulate data structures called 'Objects' - Everything in Ruby is an object
- Easy to use

## Sections: 

1. Data Types: Numbers, Strings, Boolean, Hashes, Arrays, Symbols
2. Introductory Concepts: Diff. b/w 'print' and 'puts', Mathematical Operators, Methods (.length, .upcase, .downcase), Variable Naming Conventions
3. Formatting user inputs: Prompting for input, "gets" (gets user input), capitalization of user input
4. Control flow in Ruby: Different outcomes depending on information the user types, result of computation, or value returned by another part of the program - 'if/elsif/else' conditions, unless condition, logical or boolean operators. 
5. Global Substitution: Checking for sub-strings in input string and replacing them with other characters
6. Loops and Iterators: 'while' loop, 'until' loop, 'for' loop, 'loop' method for looping, 'next' keyword for skipping, '.each' iterator, '.times' operator. 
7. Redactor: Redact the word that needs to be redacted based on user input.  
8. Data Structures: Array (Array of Numbers, Array of non-numbers, Multi-dimension array), Hashes, iteration over array, iteration over multi-dimension array, and iteration over hashes.
9. Creating a histogram: Prompting for user text input, splitting the text input into words, saving words and number of occurences of the words as count in a hash, sorting them in descending order of count and presenting them as a histogram.
10. Methods (or Functions), Blocks (similar to Lambda functions in Python), and Sorting: Methods (or Functions) are reusable section of code written to perform a specific task in a program. Blocks are a way of creating nameless methods, usually with a 'do' and 'end', or with curly braces ({}), and sorting strings alphabetically in ascending or descending order using blocks.
