# LearningRuby
Notes on learning Ruby language - learning from CodeAcademy, GeeksForGeeks and other sources

Ruby - Powerful, flexible programming language - can be used for web development, to process text, to create games, and as part of the popular Ruby on Rails framework.

- High-level: Reading and writing Ruby is very easy - looks a lot like regular English
- Interpreted: A compiler is not needed to write and run Ruby as opposed to compiled language
- Object-oriented: Allows users to manipulate data structures called 'Objects' - Everything in Ruby is an object
- Easy to use
