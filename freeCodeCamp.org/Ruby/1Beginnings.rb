# 1. puts, print and printing a simple triangle

puts "Karthik"
print "Hello World"

puts "!"

puts "   /|"
puts "  / |"
puts " /  |"
puts "/___|"

# 2. Variables - creating containers and storing values, accessing the containers whenever needed. Such containers are called variables

character_name = "John"
character_age = "35"

puts ("There once was a man named " + character_name)
puts ("he was " + character_age + " years old.")
puts ("He really liked the name " + character_name)
puts ("but didn't like being " + character_age) 
# instead of variables, if one had typed out the character name and age, future changes would take a lot of effort. hence, variables are very useful
